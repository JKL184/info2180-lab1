<p>I am currently a 2nd year UWI student majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Accounts.
     I made the decision to take this course due to an enjoyment of the Website and Webpage project in the prequisite course of Computing & Society.
     That project alongside witnessing some friends' own personal endeavors sparked an interest in Web Development and this course then came heavily recommmended by many sources such as my mentor, higher level students and my sister, who is a past student.
      I have so far enjoyed the content heavily and look forward to the rest of the course.   </p>
